To make a folder:
1. In the repository directory menu, click "add file"
2. In the name of the file, first write a directory name + forward slash, like "sub_dir/"... This instantiates a new folder. 
3. Name the first document within the folder something innocuous like "init.md" or "gitignore.md" and type a few characters.
4. Commit the new file – folder created!
